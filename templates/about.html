  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>The Student Placement Tracker is designed to simplify and streamline the entire campus recruitment process by providing an easy-to-use digital platform for both students and placement cells. Our system helps students stay updated about job opportunities, register for placements, track their applications, and receive timely notifications about interviews and results. At the same time, it enables placement officers to efficiently manage student data, schedule recruitment drives, and maintain transparent communication between companies and students.

We believe that technology can bridge the gap between students seeking career opportunities and organizations searching for the right talent. With features like student registration, placement cell management, secure login, and structured data handling, the system reduces paperwork, saves time, and ensures accuracy in every step of the recruitment process. Our goal is to create a user-friendly and reliable platform that supports students in achieving their career aspirations while helping placement cells operate in a more organized and professional way.</p>
